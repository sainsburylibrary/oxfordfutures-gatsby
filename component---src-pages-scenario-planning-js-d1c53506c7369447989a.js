In the US, institutions such as the RAND Corporation, the Hudson Institute (where Herman Kahn wrote his famous book and gave rise to the ‘thinking the unthinkable’ phrase), The Institute for the Future and The Futures Group further developed this thinking; while in France it was mostly the French government (and government-controlled firms) that pursued this practice."),r.createElement("br",null),r.createElement("br",null),r.createElement("p",null,"It is only later that the practice was tried out in companies such as Royal Dutch/Shell and GE; and EDF, the French Railways and Elf."),r.createElement("br",null),r.createElement("br",null),r.createElement("p",null,"The hiring of Pierre Wack from Shell France into Group Planning brought together aspects of the French and of the American approaches into a very potent combination.
