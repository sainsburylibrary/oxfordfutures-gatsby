        <p>
          The Art Kleiner Archive is a collection of letters, reports and other
          documents which was donated by renowned author, journalist and
          editorial consultant Art Kleiner to Green Templeton College, and
          deposited in the Oxford Futures Library.
        </p>

        <p>
          The collection consists of original publications and correspondence
          between prominent scenario planners as well as annotated drafts of
          Kleiner&rsquo;s work, amassed during the writing of{" "}
          <em>The Age of Heretics</em> (1996) and
          <em>The Fifth Discipline Fieldbook</em> (1994), which Kleiner
          developed with Peter Senge and others. Many of the items within this
          collection directly reference Pierre Wack, Shell and scenario
          planning, and as such, provide a valuable complement to the{" "}
